# AssignmentAngularProject

Assignment Angular Project
This project is an Angular application that allows users to sign up, log in, add, update, view, and delete employees. The project uses an Apollo Server Heroku backend, which is deployed at https://apollo-server-app.herokuapp.com/graphql. The backend is built using Mongoose and MongoDB

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/bycold1/101202014_COMP3133_Assignment2.git.
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd 101202014_COMP3133_Assignment2.
3. Install dependencies: npm install.
4. Start the development server: ng serve.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
